Ying Tong is a Research Scientist at the Ethereum Foundation, exploring scalability solutions like plasma and SNARK-based sidechains. She is excited about the potential for equitable self-organised communities on decentralised systems like the blockchain, and hopes RadicalxChange Singapore will be a space to discuss and experiment with unconventional modes of organisation. Ying Tong is also interested in Physics, sustainability, philosophy, literature and art, and hopes to explore these interdisciplinary synergies with this chapter and its partners.
